Homework 3

I spent a long time trying to make this work but had a really difficult time even with my tutor. Looking back, I think I got lost in the weeds when tying to assemble all of the various pieces I would need for this project. I think doing more algorithms and understanding better how to break down these little puzzles will help me to put things together better.

This was supposed to be a simple, 4 question quiz with the questions displaying as buttons that would store the user input and record the score for correct answers. 

Unfotunately, I got stuck when trying to get the questions to display and run that held me back.

I will attempt to try this again at a later date.
